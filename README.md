# AllegationsCCRB

This project is an exploration of the 
[Civilian Complaints Against New York City Police Officers dataset](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/civilian-complaints-against-new-york-city-police-officers) 
published by Propublica in July 2020.

Other data sources include:
- [Shapefile for NYPD precincts](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Police-Precincts/78dh-3ptz)
- [US Census data by NYPD precincts](https://johnkeefe.net/nyc-police-precinct-and-census-data)
- [Complaints filed to the NYPD](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i)

The Github Pages site is currently located at: [https://ratatstats.github.io/AllegationsCCRB/](https://ratatstats.github.io/AllegationsCCRB/), 
and can also be found here [https://ratatstats.github.io/AllegationsCCRB/PrecinctLevelAnalysis.html](https://ratatstats.github.io/AllegationsCCRB/PrecinctLevelAnalysis.html). The first link may be changed depending on whether additional officer-level analyses are completed.

Apologies for disregarding the project template! (I decided to go with an R markdown generated html page.)
